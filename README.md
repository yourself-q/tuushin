# tuushin

An open C++ stack for haptic teleoperation over the ordinary internet: a
master device (the operator's hand) and a slave robot, kilometres apart,
exchanging positions and forces at 1 kHz over UDP, with the operator feeling
what the robot touches and the loop staying stable whatever delay, jitter
and loss the path adds.

Force feedback across a network is stable on a laboratory LAN or a dedicated
link. On the public internet it meets tens of milliseconds of delay that
varies, packets that arrive late, out of order or not at all, clocks that are
not synchronized, and NATs. tuushin aims to be a shared, measured base for
that case: the passivity control that keeps the loop stable, the transport
that carries it, and tools that measure real paths and replay them.

**Status: early.** One degree of freedom, simulated devices, measured on
loopback so far. Developed and tested on macOS; the code is POSIX C++17 and
Linux is intended but has not been tested yet. MIT licensed.

## What is in it

| module | what it does |
|---|---|
| `control/` | Time Domain Passivity Approach (TDPA): passivity observers and controllers in the conventional two-channel form, and the variant that books energy reflection at a slave-side position coupling in one store (Panzirsch, Ryu and Ferre 2019, "Approach 3"). The passivity controllers predict the work a zero-order-held force will do on a light device instead of assuming constant velocity. |
| `codec/` | Perceptual deadband data reduction (Weber's law, Hinterseer et al. 2008). |
| `teleop/` | Master and slave controllers, the device interface (`Device1D`) with simulated devices, `HapticLink` (one end of a session over UDP), and real-time master and slave nodes. |
| `net/` | UDP sockets with kernel receive timestamps, clock-skew estimation from four-timestamp exchanges, channel models (fixed delay, jitter, Gilbert-Elliott loss, bottleneck queue, recorded traces), and path measurement with probes and a reflector. |
| `wire/` | The datagram format: a 32-byte header whose echo fields let each end measure the round trip from ordinary traffic, as RTCP does. |
| `crypto/` | A Noise_NNpsk0 handshake and ChaCha20-Poly1305 on libsodium: a pre-shared key becomes fresh keys for every session, and every datagram is authenticated and encrypted (see Authentication below). |
| `sim/` | A deterministic 1-DoF teleoperation simulator built on the same controllers and devices. |
| `tools/` | `tuushin-sim`, `tuushin-teleop` (master and slave as two processes), `tuushin-probe` (measure a path, write replayable traces). |

## Build and test

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
./build/tests/tuushin_tests          # all tests; pass a name to run a subset
```

Needs a C++17 compiler, CMake and libsodium (ISC licence):
`brew install libsodium`, or `apt install libsodium-dev pkg-config`.

## Quick start

Simulate a teleoperator touching a wall with 25 ms one-way delay:

```sh
./build/tools/tuushin-sim --passivity reflect --delay-ms 25
./build/tools/tuushin-sim --passivity channel --sweep 0,10,25,50,100
```

Run the master and the slave as separate processes over UDP (simulated
devices for now). On loopback, `--emulate-*` impairs each end's outgoing
datagrams in-process, so the measurements see the impairment as if the
network had caused it:

```sh
./build/tools/tuushin-teleop slave --port 47100 --emulate-delay 25
./build/tools/tuushin-teleop master 127.0.0.1 --port 47100 --duration 10 --emulate-delay 25
```

Each simulated device cuts its force when no command has come for two
periods, as haptic devices do (`--watchdog MS` changes it, 0 disables it;
see Loop stalls below).

Across a network the slave should accept only its own master. Make a key,
copy it to the other machine over a channel you trust (scp, say), and pass
it to both ends:

```sh
./build/tools/tuushin-teleop keygen haptic.key       # mode 0600, never overwrites
./build/tools/tuushin-teleop slave --port 47100 --key-file haptic.key
./build/tools/tuushin-teleop master HOST --port 47100 --key-file haptic.key
```

Measure a real path and replay it:

```sh
# on a reachable host
./build/tools/tuushin-probe reflect --port 47000
# on the other end: 60 s of 1 kHz probes, both directions, skew-corrected
./build/tools/tuushin-probe measure HOST --out path
./build/tools/tuushin-sim --trace-fwd path.fwd.csv --trace-bwd path.bwd.csv
```

## Results so far

### Simulation

`tuushin-sim --sweep`: a 0.2 kg master held by a simulated hand (a
spring-damper pulling it along a 4 cm, 0.5 Hz reference), a 1 kg slave in a
position coupling (2000 N/m, 60 N s/m) touching a 5000 N/m wall, 1 kHz, 10 s,
20 N actuator limit. *Margin* is the minimum over time of the energy the
teleoperator has absorbed between the two device ports; a negative margin
means it generated energy. *Displayed stiffness* is the stiffness the operator
feels while pressing into the wall; statically, the coupling and the wall in
series give about 1430 N/m.

| one-way delay | no passivity control: margin | conventional TDPA: stiffness / margin | TDPA with energy reflection: stiffness / margin |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 ms | 0 J | 1318 N/m / 0 J | 1470 N/m / 0 J |
| 5 ms | −19 J | 501 / −1.3e−4 J | 1358 / 0 J |
| 10 ms | −66 J | 112 / −1.2e−3 J | 1133 / 0 J |
| 25 ms | −410 J | 43 / −0.051 J | 438 / −3.9e−5 J |
| 50 ms | −140 J | 43 / −0.19 J | 202 / −3.7e−5 J |
| 100 ms | −461 J | 53 / −0.19 J | 110 / −8.9e−5 J |
| 200 ms | −322 J | 84 / −0.17 J | 90 / −1.8e−4 J |

Without passivity control the loop generates hundreds of joules and runs
into the force limit from 5 ms on. The conventional TDPA keeps each channel
direction passive (its channel margins stay above −2e−6 J), but not the
two-port between the devices, because the slave's coupling controller sits
outside it: energy the coupling spring stored and gives back looks generated
in the backward channel and is dissipated, the conservatism Panzirsch et al.
describe, and the displayed stiffness falls to tens of N/m. Booking the coupling inside one store
keeps several times the stiffness up to 100 ms. Its small residual margins
(under 0.2 mJ over 10 s) are not yet characterized.

### Real time, two processes on loopback

`tuushin-teleop`, same plant and controller as above, energy-reflection
scheme, 10 s sessions on macOS with the Mach time-constraint policy:

| | no emulated delay | 25 ms each way (emulated) | simulator, 25 ms |
|---|---|---|---|
| round trip, p50 / p99.9 | 0.041 / 0.107 ms | 50.04 / 50.11 ms | — |
| master tick lateness, p50 / max | 7 / 23 µs | 7 / 27 µs | — |
| samples lost | 0 | 0 | — |
| max master position | 0.0233 m | 0.0288 m | 0.0286 m |
| max displayed force | 5.017 N (simulator: 5.017 N) | 5.288 N | 5.398 N |
| master / slave PC active | 3 % / 72 % | 89 % / 75 % | 89 % / 75 % |
| min margin | 0 J | −3.6e−5 J | −3.9e−5 J |

With the same delay the real-time loop and the simulator agree to within
2 % in position, force and how often the passivity controllers act, and
their residual margins are of the same order. The one-way delays come from
the echo fields and a clock fit, with no clock synchronization between the
ends.

### Loop stalls

A control loop that is descheduled leaves its last force on the actuator
for the whole stall, and that force does work no passivity controller
checks. tuushin handles this in three parts:

- The device cuts a force that has not been renewed within two periods,
  the horizon the predictive PC already plans over (`--watchdog`). The
  servo loops of haptic devices have such a watchdog (Force Dimension's
  `dhdSetWatchdog`, for one); `Device1D::force_cut_after()` reports it.
- A force that was cut is booked as the output the controller's device
  model predicts for the time it acted, never as input.
- After a sample further than half a period from nominal, or one in which
  the force was cut, the PC applies no force until two regular samples have
  refilled the device model (2 ms at 1 kHz). Samples within half a period
  are modelled with their actual length: a loop 0.3 ms late makes the next
  sample 0.7 ms, and read as 1 ms it understates the device's velocity by
  30 %, and with it the energy a large force will draw.

A watchdog alone is not enough: with the force cut but the books not told,
they credited the operator's push during the stall as input and the
controller paid it out: after 50 to 100 ms stalls the margin fell to between
−74 and −82 mJ, worse than without a watchdog.

Worst physical margin (minus the work both actuators did on their devices)
in a virtual-time replica of the two nodes (`tests/test_teleop_stall.cpp`;
5 ms each way, energy-reflection scheme, 3 s), over 40 stall start times at
the master, the slave or both:

| | 25 ms stall | 50 ms | 100 ms | random stalls at both ends |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| no watchdog | 0 J | −0.019 J | −0.025 J | −0.019 J |
| watchdog, two periods | −5e−5 J | −6e−5 J | −4e−5 J | 0 J |

Random stalls: 30 per second at each end, 0.2 to 12 ms long, 200 runs; with
the watchdog the energy books, which are the more conservative of the two,
stay above −2e−5 J. In real time, with both nodes as threads of one process
without real-time priority on a laptop loaded with 10 busy processes (the
setup of the test `nodes_run_a_session_over_loopback`), 2 of 48 sessions
without the watchdog fell below −1 mJ (the worst to −6 mJ); with it the
worst of 48 sessions was −1e−5 J, and of 60 under 24 busy processes
−2e−5 J.

## Authentication

Without a key, anyone who can send datagrams to the slave's port can drive
the robot, and one forged datagram is enough to stall a session: claiming
a sequence number far ahead, it makes every genuine sample look stale
(`tests/test_teleop_auth.cpp` shows both). With `--key-file`:

- The master opens with a Noise_NNpsk0_25519_ChaChaPoly_SHA256 handshake
  (Perrin, *The Noise Protocol Framework*, rev. 34), the pattern for two
  ends that share only a symmetric key. Its prologue binds the session id
  and the passivity scheme. Both ends get two new keys, one per direction,
  from the pre-shared key and two ephemeral X25519 keys, so every session
  has its own keys, and a pre-shared key stolen later does not decrypt a
  recorded session (forward secrecy).
- Every haptic datagram is then sealed with ChaCha20-Poly1305: the sequence
  number is the nonce, and the header, which stays readable, is associated
  data. A datagram is authenticated before its sequence number reaches the
  replay window, so a forged one changes nothing.
- The first handshake message can be replayed: the slave cannot tell a
  recorded hello from a new one. So it starts a session only once a sample
  sealed under that handshake's keys arrives, which only the master that
  holds the ephemeral key can produce. And, as in WireGuard's initiation
  (Donenfeld, NDSS 2017), the hello carries the master's wall-clock time
  inside its encryption: the slave answers only a hello newer than the
  newest it has answered, so once a newer one has arrived a recorded hello
  costs it neither a key exchange nor a reply. A copy of the current hello, even one that arrives ahead
  of the genuine one from another address, gets the very same reply, which
  only the master can use.

What it costs, measured on an Apple M4: 16 bytes per datagram (84 instead
of 68 for one degree of freedom), 0.39 µs to seal and 0.39 µs to open one,
about 72 µs per end for the handshake, once per session. Over loopback the
round trip did not change measurably (p50 0.041 to 0.044 ms sealed, 0.041
to 0.047 ms open, five sessions each). The hello reply (80 bytes) is
smaller than the hello (88 bytes), so the slave cannot be used to amplify
traffic.

## Known issues

- **Devices need a watchdog.** The stall handling above relies on the
  device cutting a stale force by itself; a host process cannot do it while
  it is descheduled. Behind a device without one, a stalled loop leaves the
  last force on (the first row of the table above).
- **Authentication is opt-in and needs a key handed over out of band.**
  Without `--key-file` nothing is authenticated (the tools say so at start).
  The key belongs to one master-slave pair, like a WireGuard preshared key;
  there are no public-key identities, and the key changes only when you
  make a new one.
- **A flood of forged hellos costs the slave CPU** while it waits for a
  session: about 10 µs to reject each one. There is no cookie mechanism
  (WireGuard's answer to this under load).
- The slave forgets the newest hello time when it restarts, so one recorded
  hello can be answered once more afterwards (still without starting a
  session). A master whose wall clock is set back is refused until it
  passes the newest time the slave has seen.
- **Simulated devices only, one degree of freedom.** `teleop::Device1D` is
  the interface a real device will implement.
- **The slave needs a reachable UDP port.** A master behind a NAT works (the
  slave answers the address the session came from); NAT traversal for the
  slave is not implemented.
- One-way delays assume equal minimum delays in both directions, which no
  measurement between unsynchronized clocks can avoid.
- Sequence numbers do not wrap (49 days at 1 kHz).

## Next

- Traces of real paths (fibre, 4G and 5G in Japan) recorded with
  `tuushin-probe`, published so that any simulator or testbed can replay them.
- NAT traversal (STUN, hole punching), then QUIC datagrams as a transport.
- Deadbands that adapt to the measured delay; more degrees of freedom; a real
  device behind `Device1D`.
